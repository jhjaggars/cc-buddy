# Initial Request

**User Request:**

I want to build a script that automates implementing a PR with claude code. The user will invoke the script by calling it from within a git repository directory. At a minimum the script will create a worktree and start the development container with that worktree directory mounted inside the container at the /workspace path. The working directory is set to workspace. The users's github token is passed to the container via the environment. The script should keep track of which development environments it has started so that it can remove them later. The script will need a create, list, and delete command to facilitate basic usage.

## Key Components Identified:
- Git worktree management
- Development container orchestration  
- GitHub token environment handling
- State tracking for active environments
- CLI with create/list/delete commands
