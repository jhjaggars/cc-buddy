  - Interface-based design supporting both Docker and Podman
  - Auto-detection with fallback capabilities
  - Build, run, stop, remove, exec operations
  - Volume and port management
- [x] **Git Operations**:
  - Worktree creation and management
  - Branch validation and creation
  - Remote branch handling
  - Repository name extraction
- [x] **Environment Manager**:
  - Orchestrates git, container, and config operations
  - Complete environment lifecycle management
  - Atomic operations with cleanup on failure
  - State persistence and recovery

### User Interface
- [x] **Basic TUI Framework**: 
  - Bubble Tea model structure
  - View state management
  - Keyboard navigation setup
  - CLI backward compatibility mode
